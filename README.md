# Reasoning abilities of DNN
## Introduction
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the new electricity of the modern era", says Prof. Andrew Ng, a leading scientist of AI. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are becoming the driving force across a plethora of domains including healthcare, financial sector, automobile industry, agriculture e.t.c, thereby driving tremendous economic value amounting to billions. However, DNNs have primarily solved only recognition and classification problems in all of these domains. Recognition tasks like Face Recognition are easily solved by even a two year old kid. Therefore for AI to become a revolution, it has to make deep inroads into aspects like reasoning and imaginative abilities of human intelligence. A lot of research is on the rise towards this end. This project is an endeavour to add to this growing research effort towards making machines analyze, reason-out and generate images. Specifically, we have focused on Diagrammatic Abstract Reasoning (DAR) and sketch generation.
